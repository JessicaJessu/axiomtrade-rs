### Breaking Changes

This is the initial release, so no breaking changes apply.

### Migration Notes

#### From Python axiompy
This Rust implementation provides significant improvements over the Python version:

1. **Performance**: 10-100x faster execution times
2. **Memory Safety**: Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time guarantees
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors
4. **Concurrency**: Native async/await support for high-throughput operations
5. **Cross-platform**: Single binary deployment without runtime dependencies

#### Migration Steps
1. Install Rust toolkit (rustc 1.70+)
2. Add `axiomtrade-rs = "0.1.0"` to Cargo.toml
3. Update import statements to use Rust module system
4. Convert callback-based code to async/await pattern
5. Update error handling to use Result types
6. Configure environment variables for OTP automation

#### API Compatibility
The Rust API maintains functional compatibility with the Python version while providing:
- Improved error messages with detailed context
- Better type safety with compile-time validation
- Enhanced performance with zero-cost abstractions
- Native async support without callback complexity

### Future Roadmap

#### Version 0.2.0 (Q1 2025)
- GraphQL API integration for enhanced data queries
- Advanced order types (limit, stop-loss, take-profit)
- Portfolio analytics and performance metrics
- Risk management tools and position sizing
- Enhanced WebSocket reconnection strategies

#### Version 0.3.0 (Q2 2025)
- Mobile SDK compilation targets (iOS/Android)
- Advanced trading strategies and backtesting
- Machine learning integration for price prediction
- Cross-chain bridge operations
- Advanced notification system with multiple channels

#### Version 1.0.0 (Q3 2025)
- Production-ready stability guarantees
- Complete API coverage for all Axiom Trade features
- Advanced security features and audit compliance
- Performance optimizations for institutional use
- Comprehensive testing and validation suite

### Known Issues

1. **OTP Automation**: Requires manual setup of inbox.lv account and IMAP configuration
2. **WebSocket Reconnection**: Occasional delays during network transitions (will be improved in 0.2.0)
3. **Windows Compatibility**: Some examples require WSL for optimal performance
4. **Documentation**: Some advanced features need additional code examples

### Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the foundation laid by the Python axiompy library while leveraging Rust's performance and safety guarantees. Special thanks to the Axiom Trade team for providing comprehensive API documentation and testing support.

The automated OTP system was inspired by the need for seamless authentication in trading environments where manual intervention can cause missed opportunities.
