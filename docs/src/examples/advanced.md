## Automated Trading Bot

**Location**: `examples/advanced/automated_trading_bot.rs`

### Overview
A sophisticated automated trading bot demonstrating multiple strategies, risk management, and performance monitoring. This example shows how to build a production-ready algorithmic trading system.

### Architecture Patterns

#### Strategy Engine Pattern
```rust
trait TradingStrategyTrait {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn generate_signal(&self, market_data: &MarketData) -> Option<TradingSignal>;
}

struct StrategyEngine {
    strategies: Vec<Box<dyn TradingStrategyTrait>>,
}
```

The strategy engine implements a pluggable architecture allowing multiple trading strategies to operate simultaneously:
- **DCA Strategy**: Dollar-cost averaging for consistent market entry
